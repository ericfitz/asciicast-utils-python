# Claude Code prompts used to generate this project

## 1

```
I want you to implement a python script that will (1) launch a terminal-based
executable file, (2) capture stdin, stdout, and stderr output from the
launched program, (3) echo the output to the terminal where the python script
was run (4) write the captured stdio streams to an output file in asciicast
format, as the input is captured. The script will take two optional parameters:
--shell and --output, which will each require a file path. If --shell is not
provided, then the script will launch the user's $SHELL. if --output is not
provided, the script will make up a file name and write the asciicast file to
the current directory. The script should work on either MacOS or Linux. Add
the necessary TOML to the beginning of the script so that it can be launched
with "uv run" rather than having to manage a virtual environment and/or
packages.
```

## 2

```
when we write to the asciicast file, I only want to use 3 digits of precision
after the decimal point in timestamps
```

## 3

```
Pylance and ruff report several issues:
[Pasted text #1 +83 lines]
```

## 4

```
will the script start flushing lines to the output file immediately or wait
until the child shell is closed?
```

## 5

```
is there any terminal i/o that we might be missing with this approach?
```

## 6

```
Do we risk missing information due to timing precision, or do we just risk
batching? What approach would you recommend for better handling of stderr? What
escape sequences might we miss, and how might we capture them? What side
effects are there for not capturing cursor position queries and responses?
```

## 7

```
I want to implement the recommendations for (1) better stderr handling and (2)
better capture of terminal queries and terminal state changes. I do not want to
address timing precision, or binary data handling/raw byte capture.
```

## 8

```
I want you to update the readme with comprehensive data on program usage,
implementation approach, the special handling we're doing for stderr and
associated file format changes, and any other relevant information for users
to understand how it works and what its limitations are.
```

## 9

```
I want you to help me design a "shadow" feature. Basically what I want is,
while a session is being captured, I'd like to tee the output to a port and let
someone connect to the port and monitor the session. How do you suggest we
approach this? We can also leverage any command line utilities that might
already be on the system like tee or netcat... Make me a proposal.
```

## 10

```
What would happen if someone connected to the pure python socket server in the
middle of a stream? Would they encounter formatting/display issues due to
having missed the beginning of the stream?
```

## 11

```
I want to call the feature "monitor" instead of "shadow". How would we
implement state snapshot or buffering if we used the websockets + http
server approach?
```

## 12

```
how does xterm.js "catch up" if someone connects to the monitor port
mid-stream?
```

## 13

```
ok I want you to write the monitor plan for the websocket/xterm.js
implementation, to a file. I want it to be an optional command line switch in
the recorder app whether to enable monitoring, and I want to provide optional
command line parameters for monitor port and monitor interface. If no interface
is specified, we'll use "localhost" or 127.0.0.1" by default. I want you to
write a separate specification for the monitor utility, such that a user can
run a command line like "monitor_session <url>" and the utility will start the
web application in a browser window and connect to the specified url, which
will include hostname/ip and port.
```

## 14

```
create a new branch "monitor" and perform the monitor implementation phases in
that branch
```

## 15

```
I'm getting an error when I start the recoder in monitor mode:
[Pasted text #1 +23 lines]
```

## 16

```
I'm still getting errors:
[Pasted text #1 +16 lines]
```

## 17

```
I don't want you to ever do git commits.
```

## 18

```
I want to write a python script that is a playback utility for my asciicast v2
files (with my additional e record type). The script should print out help
(syntax, examples, etc.) if no parameters are provided. If an asciicast file
(.cast) is provided as a parameter, the playback utility should create a new
terminal-type window (must work on Linux or macos) and play the session back.
```

## 19

```
recording_20250803_183913.cast is 108.426 seconds long but the playback window
was only on my screen for a second or two
```

## 20

```
Will the playback script work on Linux as well as MacOS?
```

## 21

```
in playback_session.py, I want to be able to press the space bar to pause
playback (or unpause and continue, if paused). I also want to be able to press
the "tab" key to play back to the next marker immediately and then pause.
```

## 22

```
Where are the status messages displayed
```

## 23

```
I don't want the messages to appear in the playback experience - I want to put
them in the terminal window title instead
```

## 24

```
in record_session.py, when there is no activity for at least 5 seconds and then
activity resumes, I want to add a marker ('m') record immediately before the
the record for the resumed input. In other words, there might be a long gap
with no records and then the next record would be a marker record and then
activity records. Do this anytime there is a gap of 5 seconds or more.
```

## 25

```
the monitor feature causes a number of artifacts in the recorded stream - you
can see this in recording_20250803_183913.cast. I don't want artifacts caused
by monitor_session.py to be visible in the child shell or in the cast file.
```

## 26

```
I just started a new recording session and I saw this text in the session being
recorded, as soon as I connected to the monitoring session:
127.0.0.1 - - [03/Aug/2025 19:17:30] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

## 27

```
for testing, just describe the test scenario and ask me to perform the
operations; don't bother writing complex test scripts. I still see an
extraneous message in the recording files:
[112.241, "e", "\nSaving session..."]
[112.246, "e", "completed.\n"]
```

## 28

```
Also, during playbacks, space and tab are not working in the window where we're
watching the session, and that window is not getting its title updated when
we're paused, etc.
```

## 29

```
The "Start" message appears in the playback window's title. After that, no
further messages appear in the playback window's title, and spaces and tabs are
inserted into the session being played back
```

## 30

```
ok the title bars are updating as expected and the keys are working as
expected. the [DEBUG] messages appear IN the playback terminal.
```

## 31

```
test_basic.cast does NOT have the message
```

## 32

```
how can we test whether we've eliminated all the http events from the
recordings?
```

## 33

```
please update the readme file with any relevant information based on our
changes. Please add comments to the scripts where we implemented special
logic to work around problems. Please review the command line help for the 3
tools and update anything that is incomplete or incorrect.
```

## 34 Aligning implementation of resize records with Asciicast v2 standard

```
In our project, we made a change to the asciicast file format "r" ("resize")
record type.

Normal asciicast v2 uses this format:
[5.0, "r", "100x50"]
where the data "100x50" indicates 50 lines of 100 columns

In our modified version, we use this format:
[2.567, "r", "24,80"]
where the data "24,80" indicates 24 lines of 80 columns.

Please change our implementation to match the asciicast standard.  This means
changing the order of the values in the data, and changing the delimiter from
"," to "x".  At a minimum, we need to change record_session.py and
playback_session.py and remove the text in the readme that indicates we're
using a different format than normal asciicast v2.  But check for code
elsewhere like in the monitor_session.py script and any other references
anywhere in the project.
```
